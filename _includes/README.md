# _includes is a Jekyll folder

This is third importance directory as it stores reusable HTML parts for Jekyll _layouts.
Without _includes html layouts in _layouts would feel bloated.

We store everything in the _includes, so that layots would be more readable.

When you will open any of _layouts, you will see that there is lots of include Liquid tags that are pointing to files in this directory.
